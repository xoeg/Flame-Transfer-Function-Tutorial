Before starting take a look at the following video. The combustion group at NTNU introduces the basics of the Flame Transfer Function and show the experimental set up required to measure one.

Flame transfer functions are used in linear stability analyses to determine whether a given operating point is prone to thermo-acoustic instabilities.  

# FTF Tutorial 
In this tutorial we will learn how to measure FTFs. For this we will need to force a flame and record how it responds. You can see an example in the following animation.

* On the left plot we have the pressure measurements recorded by the microphones (blue probes).
* On the right plot we have the heat release as captured by the PMT (yellow box).
* On the bottom plot you can see the flame in our combustor being forced. 

After some treatment of these measurements one can compute the FTF.
