# Day 4 - Measurement of the Flame Transfer Matrix
In this tutorial we will measure:
* The **Burner Transfer Matrix**. This shows the relationship between the upstream and downstream acoustic variables in a during cold flow operation.
* The **Flame Transfer Matrix**. This shows the relationship between the upstream and downstream acoustic variables in a during hot flow operation.

The following figure shows the latter, where the F22 element contains embedded the FTF.
