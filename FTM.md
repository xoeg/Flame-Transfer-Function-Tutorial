title: Measurement of the Flame Transfer Matrix
description: Jos√© G. Aguilar - NTNU

Flame Transfer Matrices (FTM) are a generalization of the concept introduced by the Flame Transfer Function. This time instead of studying the response of just the heat release to velocity fluctuations, we are interested in studying the full acoustic response of the burner and the flame. To achieve this, we need to force the combustor upstream and downstream of the region of interest.

# FTM tutorial
In this tutorial we will measure:
* The **Burner Transfer Matrix**. This shows the relationship between the upstream and downstream acoustic variables in a during cold flow operation.
* The **Flame Transfer Matrix**. This shows the relationship between the upstream and downstream acoustic variables in a during hot flow operation.

The following figure shows the latter, where the F22 element contains embedded the FTF.
