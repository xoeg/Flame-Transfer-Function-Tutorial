# Day 1 - Measurement of a Flame Transfer Function

The tutorial for day 1 is divided in 2 parts:
1. Multi-Microphone-Method.
2. Measurement of a flame transfer function.

## Multi-Microphone-Method
The Multi-Microphone-Method (MMM) is used to reconstruct the acoustic field in a given geometry. If we know the mean flow, the MMM can be useful when we want to estimate the acoustic velocity from pressure measurements. In fact, if we have at least 2 measurements of pressure and/or velocity we can obtain a third one at a different location using this method. 

### MMM Tutorial 
In the following part of the tutorial, we reconstruct the acoustic velocity using pressure measurements and then we compare it to the velocity measured by a hot wire anemometer. You can see the result in the following animation.

* On the top left we record the velocity measured by the hot wire at a location x = 0.2 m (red).
* On the middle left we show two pressure measurements at x = -0.2 m (dark blue) and x = -0.4 m (blue).
* On the top right we plot in red the signal from the hot wire (same as in the top left) and in blue the signal reconstructed from the pressure measurements. They are almost on top of each other!
* At the bottom we show the acoustic pressure field and the location of the probes.

## Flame-Transfer-Function Measurement
Flame transfer functions are used on linear stability analyses to determine whether a given operating point is prone to thermo-acoustic instabilities.  

### FTF Tutorial 
In this tutorial we will learn how to measure FTFs. For this we will need to force a flame and record how it responds. You can see an example in the following animation.

* On the left plot we have the pressure measurements recorded by the microphones (blue probes).
* On the right plot we have the heat release as captured by the PMT (yellow box).
* On the bottom plot you can see the flame in our combustor being forced. 

After some treatment of these measurements one can compute the FTF.
