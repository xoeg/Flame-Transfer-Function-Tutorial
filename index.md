In this tutorial you will learn some basic tools used to study thermoacoustic oscillations from an experimental perspective. That is, we are going to simulate a combustion rig and obtain some measurements as if we were performing them in a laboratory test rig. 

We are going to focus on these techniques:

*  Spectral estimation (NOT FINISHED)
*  Multi-Microphone-Method
*  Flame-Transfer-Function Measurement (NOT FINISHED)

# Spectral estimation (NOT FINISHED)
TBD
