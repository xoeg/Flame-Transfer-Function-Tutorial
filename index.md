In the following tutorial you will learn some basic tools used to study thermoacoustic oscillations from an experimental perspective. That is, we are going to simulate a combustion rig and obtain some measurements as if we were performing them in a laboratory test rig. 

We are going to focus on two techniques:

*  Multi-Microphone-Method
*  Flame-Transfer-Function

# Introduction
The following video will introduce you to thermoacoustic instabilities and the topics above, so begin by watching it.
