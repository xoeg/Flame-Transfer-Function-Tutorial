In this tutorial you will learn some basic tools used to study thermoacoustic oscillations from an experimental perspective. That is, we are going to simulate a combustion rig and obtain some measurements as if we were performing them in a laboratory test rig. 

We are going to focus on these techniques:

*  Spectral estimation 
*  Multi-Microphone-Method
*  Flame-Transfer-Function Measurement

# Spectral estimation
TBD

# Multi-Microphone-Method
The Multi-Microphone-Method (MMM) is used to reconstruct the acoustic field in a given geometry. If we know the mean flow, the MMM can be useful when we want to estimate the acoustic velocity from pressure measurements. In fact, if we know at least 2 measurements (pressure or velocity) we can obtain a third one at a different location using this method. 

## Tutorial (MMM)
In the following part of the tutorial we reconstruct the acoustic velocity using pressure measurements and then we copare it to the velocity measured by a hot wire anemometer. You can see the result in the following image:
