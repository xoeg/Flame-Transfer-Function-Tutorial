# Day 1 - Measurement of a Flame Transfer Function (José G. Aguilar - NTNU) 

In the first day we will revise the multi-microphone-method and measure a flame transfer function. The tutorial is divided in 2

## Multi-Microphone-Method
The Multi-Microphone-Method (MMM) is used to reconstruct the acoustic field in a given geometry. If we know the mean flow, the MMM can be useful when we want to estimate the acoustic velocity from pressure measurements. In fact, if we have at least 2 measurements of pressure and/or velocity we can obtain a third one at a different location using this method. 

### MMM Tutorial 
In the following part of the tutorial we reconstruct the acoustic velocity using pressure measurements and then we compare it to the velocity measured by a hot wire anemometer. You can see the result in the following image. 

* On the top left we record the velocity measured by the hot wire at a location x = 0.2 m (red).
* On the middle left we show two pressure measurements at x = -0.2 m (dark blue) and x = -0.4 m (blue).
* On the top right we plot in red the signal from the hot wire (same as in the top left) and in blue the signal reconstructed from the pressure measurements. They are almost on top of each other!
* At the bottom we show the acoustic pressure field and the location of the probes.
